# Coding conventions

> Code, symbols, and file paths are English.

This page carries only what is specific to implementing signature schemes. The
rules every FRX consumer shares — `@jit` placement, `for` vs `lax.scan` vs
`vmap`, pytree registration mechanics, seam conformance pins, the `testing/`
layout, the comment rules — are not repeated here. They are identical in every
repo built on FRX, and a copy per repo is exactly how they drift apart.

## Batch verification is the compilation unit

A scheme's `verify` takes the whole batch and must trace as one computation. The
`@jit` boundary belongs around it, never around a per-signature body that a
driver loop calls `B` times.

This is the rule the `Signature` seam exists to enforce
([`../../sig_frx/signature.py`](../../sig_frx/signature.py)) — there is no scalar
`verify` to implement, so a Python loop over the batch axis is a bug rather than
a slow path. Batch `keygen` and `sign` with `frx.vmap` when a caller needs it;
they are not the hot path and do not get their own entry points.

## A rejection loop is not a `while` on secret data

"Sample until the candidate is in range" — ML-DSA's signing loop, Falcon's
Gaussian sampler — has no data-dependent trip count available on device. It is
sampled in fixed-size blocks with a mask, or it runs on the host. Which one a
scheme picks is a decision its page records, along with the timing consequence
([`security.md`](security.md)).

## The lattice NTT is per-repo, and the shape is the shared part

ML-DSA's NTT lives here; ML-KEM's lives in
[`enc-frx`](https://github.com/fractalyze/enc-frx). They are deliberately not
shared, and the reason is not that sharing would be hard — it is that the two
transforms disagree about the things a shared implementation would have to hold
fixed.

| | ML-DSA (FIPS 204) | ML-KEM (FIPS 203) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| modulus | 8380417 (23-bit) | 3329 (12-bit) |
| depth | 8 layers, complete | 7 layers, **incomplete** |
| base case | pointwise | degree-1 products mod `X² − ζ` |
| worst-case product | 2^46 — **exceeds a lane** | 2^24 — fits |

The last row decides it, and it is the repo's first non-negotiable applied to
arithmetic: an integer array lane is 32 bits. A product of two ML-DSA residues is
about 7·10^13, which a lane neither holds nor complains about — it returns a wrong
number. ML-KEM's worst case is 11075584 and computes exactly. So ML-DSA needs a
split representation that ML-KEM does not, and an NTT "parameterized over the
modulus" would be parameterizing the representation of a field element rather than
a constant.

The depth difference says the same thing about the algorithm rather than the
arithmetic: ML-KEM stops one layer early and its base case multiplies degree-1
polynomials, so that step is different code, not a different constant.

What is genuinely common is the layer-walk skeleton — a few dozen lines, which is
not enough to carry a cross-repo pin. `hash-frx` is the wrong home for it in any
case, being the *symmetric* layer: a lattice NTT is not a hash and does not belong
there merely because both repos already depend on it.

So each repo implements its own, and the convention is that the two **look
alike**: same module layout, the same names (`ntt`, `intt`, `base_mul`,
`montgomery_reduce`), the same twiddle-table generation style. The cost being
avoided is not duplicated lines — it is two implementations that look unrelated,
so a bug fixed in one is never looked for in the other. Whoever writes the second
should be able to read the first.

Revisit when a third lattice scheme appears. Two implementations are not evidence
for an abstraction; three usually are.

## Keys and signatures are bytes at the seam

They cross the `Signature` seam as `uint8` arrays in the standard's encoding, not
as scheme-named pytrees: a consumer holds bytes, and a seam taking a structured
form would make it call a scheme-specific decode first — which means naming the
scheme, which is what the seam exists to prevent. A scheme parses its own
encoding on entry, and any structured form it wants across calls is its own
surface, below the seam.

Inside a scheme, whatever crosses a `jit` / `vmap` boundary is a registered
frozen dataclass, and a scheme instance carried as pytree aux needs value-based
`__eq__`/`__hash__` — which is why the seam requires them. Identity equality does
not error; it silently re-traces the enclosing zone for every freshly built
instance, so it surfaces as a slow call and never as a failure.

A parameter record that never crosses a boundary stays plain data.

## The context is part of what gets signed

FIPS 204 and 205 both take an application context string, and it changes the
message the scheme signs — so `sign` and `verify` take it and a scheme never
accepts one it then ignores. A scheme whose standard has no context requires it
empty and raises otherwise.

One context per call, not per batch entry: a verifier serves one protocol domain
at a time.

The seam names the standards' plain external interface. A variant that prepares a
different message — a pre-hashed message, the internal interface, a pre-computed
message representative — is a different operation and lives under the scheme's
own name, not on the seam.

## No blockchain in a core

Ethereum's and Bitcoin's conventions — message hashing, recovery, low-`S`, DER —
ride as variants over the curve-level core. `ecdsa/` holds no `eth_` symbol, and
a chain name inside a core module is the smell that a variant leaked downward.

## Cite the standard, by section

A magic constant, a domain separator, or a padding rule carries the document and
section it comes from: `# FIPS 205 §4.2`, not `# domain separator`. Signature
code is easy to write plausibly and wrongly, and the section number is what lets
a reviewer check it rather than agree with it.

## Known-answer tests are the gate

A scheme that reproduces every published signature byte and accepts every
published vector has proven nothing about rejection: a verifier that returns
`True` unconditionally passes all of it. Corrupt the signature, the message, and
the public key, and pin the verdicts — the negative cases are half the gate.

Self-consistency is not evidence either. Sign-then-verify round-trips forever
inside a self-consistent wrong implementation. Property-based tests supplement
the KATs; they never replace them.

An exhaustive sweep — every parameter set against every published vector — is
tagged `slow_kat`, which drops it from the per-PR run and keeps it in the
scheduled one.

### Vectors are fetched and pinned, never committed

A vector set is declared as an `http_file` in [`MODULE.bazel`](../../MODULE.bazel)
with a sha256 and a URL pinned to a specific upstream commit, and reaches a test
through `data`. The published sets run to tens of megabytes — SLH-DSA sigGen's
expected results alone are 31 MB — and committing them taxes every clone forever
for data that never changes after publication. The sha256 means a swapped or
truncated fetch fails the build rather than silently changing what a scheme is
gated on, and the repository cache makes every build after the first offline.

Pin the URL to a commit, never a branch: NIST regenerates these files in place,
and a moving URL turns an upstream regeneration into a mystery failure here.

### Not every scheme is driven by the shared harness

[`kat.py`](../../sig_frx/testing/kat.py) normalizes published *formats* into one
record so one driver gates every scheme. A scheme belongs behind it when there is
a format to normalize and the scheme implements `Signature`. Where neither holds,
the scheme's own test is the gate and says so in its docstring — which is a
narrower exception than it sounds, and it earns its place only by naming both
halves:

- **No format.** A standard with no published vector file leaves a handful of
  values transcribed from whatever authority replaces it, with the provenance in
  the module that holds them. There is nothing for a loader to parse, so routing
  them through one would add a hop and normalize nothing.
- **Not on the seam.** A stateful scheme has no seam-shaped `sign` (see
  [`signature.py`](../../sig_frx/signature.py)), and the harness signs through
  `Signature`. An adapter could satisfy the Protocol by discarding the advanced
  key — but that is not a different operation the way the internal and pre-hash
  interfaces are, it is the operation with the property that makes it safe
  removed, and it would sit in the tree one import away from a caller who wanted
  a simpler `sign`.

What such a scheme owes instead is the rest of this section in full: the negative
cases, and every rejection its own structure makes possible that a generic bit
flip would not reach.

### A vector the harness cannot run is an error, not a skip

A standard's vector set covers every mode of its interface — FIPS 204 publishes
a signing context, a pre-hash variant, and an external-mu variant, each a
different operation from the plain one. A loader records what it could not
express instead of dropping it, and the harness refuses the case. Running the
plain operation against a vector published for another one reports a pass for a
case nobody ran, which is worse than a failure because it looks like coverage.

## Scheme doc skeleton

Every page in [`../schemes/`](../schemes) answers three things, and everything
else is optional — don't pad to fill a template.

- **What the standard fixes and what this implementation chooses.** Parameter
  sets, encodings, and domain separators are the standard's; the batching, the
  loop shapes, and the pytree layout are this repo's.
- **Where the batch axis is.** Which operations are batched, what shape they take,
  and what a caller vmaps if they need more.
- **What leaks.** The scheme's data-dependent operations, named — see
  [`security.md`](security.md).
